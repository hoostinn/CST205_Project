# Weather App Project

Resources leveraged:
- **PySide6 (Qt)** for the GUI  
- **Folium** for interactive maps
- **OpenStreetMap** to get location information
- **Open-Meteo API** for weather data  
- **Local styles, images, icons, and audio**

This QtApplication can take in a location (via zip code or city/city, state) to get real time weather information for that location, including the temperature, percepitation information, etc. There is also an interactive map which users can click a location on, and receive that location's weather information.
