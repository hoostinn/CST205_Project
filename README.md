# Weather App Project - Team 12475 CST 205

## Overview  
Our final project is a desktop weather application built with Python + PySide6 (Qt) that lets users view current weather and forecast information. The QtApplication can take in a location (via zip code or city/city, state) to get real time weather information for that location, including the temperature, percepitation information, etc. There is also an interactive map which users can click on a location and receive that location's weather information. ⛅

## Resources leveraged:
- PySide6 (Qt) for the GUI  
- Folium for an interactive map
- OpenStreetMap to get location information
- Open-Meteo API for weather data  
- Custom made images, icons, and other interactive features for a clean experience

## Features  
- Fetch current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.) for a given location
- Display interactive map to show location/weather using Folium  
- GUI using PySide6 (Qt)
- Custom styling and UI themes  
- Clean file separation between API logic, UI, and data handling
